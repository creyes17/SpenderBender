Below are conventions for all drawable Android resources.

File Naming:
	Drawable resources should be named using snake_case (all lowercased with words separated by underscores).
	They should be prefixed by their asset type:
		Button: "button_"
		Icon: "icon_"
	If you find yourself needing to add a drawable resource for an asset type not listed above, please add it to the list.
