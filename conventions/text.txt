Below are conventions for all plain text files.

Copyright and Contributions:
	Plain text files should contain the standard copyright notice, followed by a blank line, 3 dashes, and another blank line.
	If you are creating a new text file, you should add the contribution section with the format: "Created by {Your Name}: {Date in MM/DD/YYYY format}". 
		This should be followed by a blank line, 3 dashes, and another blank line.
	If you are the first non-creator contributor to a text file, you should add the contributors list. Immediately underneath the "Created by" line:
		Add a line: "Contributors:"
		Add your name on a new line by itself
	If you are contributing for the first time on an existing text file with existing contributors, add your name on a new line by itself in the "Contributors" list.
		Sort the list alphabetically, uppercased letters before lowercased ones, and spaces before letters.

File Naming:
	Plain text files should be stored with a .txt extension.
	They should be named in snake_case. (So all lowercased-letters separated by underscores).
	An example might be: my_very_long_file_name.txt
